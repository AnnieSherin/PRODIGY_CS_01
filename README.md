# PRODIGY_CS_01

This project demonstrates a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption and decryption algorithm. The program allows users to encrypt or decrypt text using a specified shift value.

Features:
-Encrypt messages with a Caesar Cipher.

-Decrypt messages that were encoded with a Caesar Cipher.

-Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.

-Retains non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, numbers, punctuation) as-is.
